  <h4><Span style ="color:red">Company Information</Span></h4>

 <p>Global Heritage Fund is a non-profit organization that operates internationally. Its mission statement says that it exists to protect and preserve significant and endangered cultural heritage sites in the developing world, through scientific excellence and community development. GHF specifically focuses its funding and conservation efforts on the developing world because of the scarce human and technical resources in those countries to protect their historical treasures, and for the economic promise heritage sites have as community-based, responsibly-managed tourist destinations.</p>

  <h4><Span style ="color:red">Before our project</Span></h4>

<p>Our team created a pilot project until Global Heritage Fund gives us the authorization which enables us to extract contents on the website. For the pilot project, four Chinese-speaking translators with high linguistic competencies at MIIS translated English text with 6,059 words into Chinese. Before the project was launched, I created a quote for this project and a cloud-based work space in Asana which is a web and mobile application designed to help teams track. TransForce members communicated with each other through Asana, and wrote a translators' manual for their better understanding of MateCat. MateCat is an official CAT tools that translators can use for this project. I sent an email to four translators with the attached files of the translators' manual and the style guide, and regularly communicated with them regarding any questions or concerns on this project.</p>
