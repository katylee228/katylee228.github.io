<h4 class = "red">Pilot Project</h4>

<p>Our team communicated on Asana most of the time. As a project manager, I assigned work to team members and set the deadlines on Asana so that they can get notifications by email when it's due. When they click the check box after finishing their work, other team members will also get the notifications that their work is done. All of our team members  left comments in Conversations and upload/downloaded files in Files on Asana. Our team loves Asana as a communication tool, but it's not a good place to organize our files since there are no folders which allow hierarchical structures.

So we used Google Drive for our file organization because we can store big files and use folders in other folders in the Google Drive. Even though it was inconvenient to have a separate file storage space, Google Drive has been very  useful to store and organize files.

For our pilot project, I created a translation project on MateCat which can split the translation equally. It also shows the total words of our project and the progress of their translation. The MIIS translators received the links on MateCat with the translator's manual and the translation style guide. However, some translators had misunderstanding on MateCat and didn't meet the deadline since MateCat is very different from SDL Trados in its use. Our team realized that a kickoff meeting with translators is very important because it can enhance the communication with translators and  their understanding of CAT tools. The pilot project was a great practice before we launched our full project. </p>





<h4 class = "red">Full Project</h4>

<p>Since our team didn't receive the authorization two months after the project began, we decided to make a demo site as an alternative to a "fully-cloned" site. It was a good chance for us to demonstrate our quality translation and technical skills to our client. For our full project, we worked with 14 Shanghai International Studies University (SHISU) translators. Translators had to translate 15,000 words for 6 weeks. Since the translators at SHISU had a training for quality translation with our team members before they start translating, it was much easier for me (as a project manager) to manage 14 translators online.

I communicated with the 14 SHISU translators on Asana since they are located in China. I uploaded the style guide, the translators' manual, and the MateCat links on Asana. By clicking their own links, they can start their translation after reading the style guide and the translators' manual. The translators communicated with each other freely on Asana and MateCat by leaving lots of comments regarding their translation.

Since we got Translation Memory and Glossaries from our pilot project, I added the TMs and TDs which were saved on MateCat to our full project. By using TMs and TDs, translators could complete their translation more easily and consistently. For the translation quality, the translators also worked as editors. They edited others' translation works before they submit their final translation.</p>


<h4 class = "red">Value added project</h4>

<p>Our team also worked on graphic localization and video subtitling translation. We localized 1 graphic and 4 English videos on the website into Chinese. Since the graphic on the webpage could be downloaded as a PDF file, our team could easily localize its content into Chinese.  For the video localization, our team first transcribed the video subtitles through the subtitling tool "Aegisub". And then I uploaded the files on MateCat so that the MIIS translators can translate the content using MateCat. Lastly, our Chinese team members reviewed their translation before we put the translated files back to the video for the translation quality.</p>
